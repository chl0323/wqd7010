## Abstract
This paper designs and implements a secure BLE vehicle lock communication system based on ECDH and AES-GCM. The system achieves secure key agreement through the ECDH key exchange protocol, uses AES-GCM for command encryption, and implements an anti-replay attack mechanism. Experimental results show that the system can effectively protect BLE vehicle lock communication security and resist common man-in-the-middle and replay attacks.

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Background
With the development of IoT technology, BLE vehicle lock systems are widely used in automotive security. However, the security of BLE communication faces many challenges, such as man-in-the-middle attacks and replay attacks. Therefore, designing a secure and reliable BLE vehicle lock communication system is of great significance.

### 1.2 Project Scope
This project mainly studies the following aspects:
- Application of ECDH key exchange protocol in BLE vehicle locks
- Application of AES-GCM encryption algorithm in command transmission
- Design and implementation of anti-replay attack mechanism
- System performance evaluation and security analysis

### 1.3 Limitations
- Only supports basic unlock command
- No user authentication mechanism implemented
- Physical security protection not considered

## 2. Literature Review
### 2.1 ECDH Key Exchange
ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) is a key exchange protocol based on elliptic curves, featuring high computational efficiency and short key length.

### 2.2 AES-GCM Encryption
AES-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard - Galois/Counter Mode) is an authenticated encryption algorithm that provides both confidentiality and integrity protection.

### 2.3 BLE Security Research Status
[Related research literature review]

## 3. System Design and Implementation
### 3.1 System Architecture
The system consists of the following components:
- BLE server (vehicle lock side)
- BLE client (mobile side)
- Attack demonstration module
- Performance analysis module

### 3.2 Key Algorithm Implementation
#### 3.2.1 ECDH Key Exchange
```python
def derive_shared_secret(private_key, peer_public_key):
    return private_key.exchange(ec.ECDH(), peer_public_key)
```

#### 3.2.2 AES-GCM Encryption
```python
def encrypt_command(aes_key, plaintext):
    aesgcm = AESGCM(aes_key)
    nonce = os.urandom(12)
    ciphertext = aesgcm.encrypt(nonce, plaintext, None)
    return nonce, ciphertext
```

### 3.3 Anti-Replay Attack Mechanism
```python
def is_nonce_used(nonce):
    if nonce in used_nonces:
        return True
    used_nonces.add(nonce)
    return False
```

## 4. Results
### 4.1 Performance Test
- Memory usage: {performance_data['memory_mb']:.2f} MB
- CPU usage: {performance_data['cpu_percent']}%

### 4.2 Security Test
#### 4.2.1 Man-in-the-Middle Attack Test
- Attack success rate: {attack_results.get('mitm_success_rate', 'N/A')}%
- Average attack time: {attack_results.get('mitm_avg_time', 'N/A')}ms

#### 4.2.2 Replay Attack Test
- Attack detection rate: {attack_results.get('replay_detection_rate', 'N/A')}%
- Average detection time: {attack_results.get('replay_avg_time', 'N/A')}ms

## 5. Conclusions
1. The system successfully implements secure communication based on ECDH and AES-GCM
2. The anti-replay attack mechanism effectively resists replay attacks
3. The system performance meets practical application requirements

## 6. Recommendations
1. Add user authentication mechanism
2. Implement physical security protection
3. Optimize key update mechanism
4. Extend support for more command types
